Ascend XYZ Data Platform
------------

#Data

###Datasets
The Ascend XYZ Data Platform keeps collections of Datasets, where each Dataset contains a set of Dataset Items. The storage behind these are made for high scalability and is accessible by a rest api.
An arbitrary number of properties can be added to the Dataset itself and everything is represented by simple Key=Value properties. Using the REST Api this means developers have access to a high saleable schema free repository. These Datasets are the very fundamental of the Data Platform and depending on the use cases some properties may be required to visualize the data.¨

From a GIS perspective these dataset can be used as layers, where each item then represent a feature.
Datasets can also represent GPS tracks from data collection systems like the Ascend Data Acquisition systems (ground and air).

###Dataset Items


#Visualizers

On the Ascend Portal users and developers may access their data and visualize them in some of the viewers that we have made available. It’s also here sample sets for the classification environment can be created.
